# Harpy
A custom project builder for any language you want. So far it includes Java, Python and Kotlin. More will be added as time goes on.

<h1>Hello there and welcome to Harpy, created by SsTellaaa</h1>

<p>Some tools you might need:
<ol>
    <li>1. nim</li>
    <li>2. Gcc</li>
    <li>3. Compiler of your chosen language.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
If you have nim already, make sure to compile it with..
```nim
    nim c -o:harpy main.nim
```
</p>

<h2>then run it with ./main if on linux or run the exe.</h2>

<h1>Installation instructions for ease of use!</h1>

<h2>Linux</h2>

-----
sudo mv harpy /usr/local/bin/
Doing the sudo mv should be enough, if it doesnt work, feel free to continue.
---
Then go into your ~/.bashrc file and enter the following command.
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
$PATH is where harpy will be, so it would be /usr/local/bin

<h3>Windows instructions coming soon</h3>
